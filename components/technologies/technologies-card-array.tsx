It is particularly suitable for low-temperature heat sources, making it well-suited for waste heat recovery applications. The ORC cycle is similar to the traditional Rankine cycle used in steam power plants but operates at lower temperatures using organic fluids as the working fluid. The system is claimed as the most advanced waste heat recovery system with high thermal efficiency characterized as oil-free, fully sealed, and maintenance-free',
